<html ng-app>   <!-- ng-app is a built-in Angular "directive"
                     which defines the Angular app boundary; 
                     in this case, from the starting <html> 
                     tag to the closing </html> tag -->

  <body>
    <p ng-init=" name='World' ">Hello {{name}}!</p>
       <!-- here ng-init is a convenient "directive" which Angular
            provides to let you run code prior to execution of the
            main Angular template. In this case, we simply initialize
            the variable "name" with the value "World". According to 
            the Angular developers, this is a shortcut for toy/test
            applications. We'll use it for the moment and get a bit
            more professional shortly.
